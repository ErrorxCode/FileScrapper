# FileScrapper ~ Downloading become easy ;)

This is an android library (aar) by which you can use any file hosting service as an alternative to firebase storage. Alternative because you can only download files, you can't upload (will be available in future).
You can download files from Mediafires, Drive, Anonfiles (more in next release).
